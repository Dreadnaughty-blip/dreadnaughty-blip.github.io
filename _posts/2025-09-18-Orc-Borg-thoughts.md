Past weekend I DM'd a series of three one-shots at a local con. I chose the system <a href="(https://gshowitt.itch.io/orc-borg) target="_blank">ORC BORG</a> by Grant Howitt and ROLLINKUNZ (Goblin Industries). It's a <a href="https://www.morkborg.com" target="_blank">Mork Borg</a> derivative, which means it's a Rules Light, OSR (Old School Renaissance) TTRPG where death waits around every corner, but that's ok because all characters are more or less interchangable. 

I brought mini's, a battlemat and a stack of character sheets. I printed the rules (which conveniently fit on two pages) and we were off!
