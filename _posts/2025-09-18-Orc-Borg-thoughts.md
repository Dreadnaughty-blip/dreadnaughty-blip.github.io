Past weekend I DM'd a series of three one-shots at a local con. I chose the system <a href="https://gshowitt.itch.io/orc-borg" target="_blank">ORC BORG</a> by Grant Howitt and ROLLINKUNZ (Goblin Industries). It's a <a href="https://www.morkborg.com" target="_blank">Mork Borg</a> derivative, which means it's a Rules Light, OSR (Old School Renaissance) TTRPG where death waits around every corner, but that's ok because all characters are more or less interchangable. 

I brought mini's, a battlemat and a stack of character sheets. I printed the rules (which conveniently fit on two pages) and we were off!

**The One Shot**
I playtested a one shot on two occasions, and somewhere in between those two playtests I realized this wasn't an issue of rules or complicated dice rolls or maths... but of pacing. 

The setting is already great: Warhammer 40K Orcs on a ship beating everything to pulp is setting enough. The color scheme (see picture of Grimy above) is bonkers but so attractive for a full blast metal ram-fest. The minis, which I borrowed and 3D-printed from WH40K Orcs and painted are awesome. The limit is imagination, but with multiple people at the table even that doesn't seem too much of a barrier. 

Now, in a con-setting, you are not just DM'ing a game. You're also selling the system. And that means having to make sure the players have fun, but also enough of a challenge. Usually trying to gently thrum out their creative side helps. So this One Shot needed to impress. I was solo RPG'ing a different system and at some point I narrated getting chased. Now that had all the adrenaline I was looking for! Then I was reminded of the great 1979 movie The Warriors, which is in essence a chase movie. The plot is relatively simple: gangs get called to a meeting by a Big Boss, Big Boss gets shot, protaganist gang gets blamed, they need to flee using trains/subways/metro's to their home turf, where they are able to confront and beat the Big-Boss-killer, thus getting an awesome ending. 

Usually for a one shot I tend to do 3 or 4 encounters, with one being a puzzle or a mystery solving, one a diplomacy challenge and two just good old throw-downs. Not for this One Shot: it was a grind fest: 4 straight up brutal beatdowns. 

So the story line is like this: players at the table are a gang (they get to decide the name), they are ordered to retrieve a drum from the toughest gang on board the Derelict. To travel between compartments/hulls they take trains. Every train is unique in which faction controls the train. 

1. One train is controlled by goblins/grots, which makes it just a undercarriage on a train track, hanging wires, no walls and a couple of seats. This train has a little red light which tells the players when to duck as it goes pedal-to-the-metal through these tunnels with hanging bars, sudden bumps etc. But hey, it works. Players loved this train because it give them so many opportunities to yeet guys off the train or to try and hang on the edge.
