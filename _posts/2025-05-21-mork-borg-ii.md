# Magnificent Usk is doing well in a city crawl
The last time we left our anti-hero and SCVM was when he had just found the bones of his employer's son. At least he took revenge on the wyvern 
by wrecking it but still, there was the little unfortunate bit of having to tell the boss his son was dead. 

Well it didn't go over very well. Despondent and nearly catatonic the lord ordered him back to Grift to find the family gravemound and bring him the bones of 
the child's mother, so that he may kick off this armageddon early by mass exodus of him and his people... but with the remains of his family. Usk initially was 
inclined to just... fuck off and not do it, but something enticed him after a lifetime of being a terrible human being that this may be his... redemption? 

Well at least a drop in the bucket. 

Without too much trouble he arrived in Grift, but then Usk realized the gravemound's location was little fuzzy to say the least. Instructions were: past the library, past the 
church, bypass the Lord Goodall's mansion then just past the market. Seemed straightforward enough. Well it got pretty weird from there. In Rorschach's journal style:

# Library
1. Got accosted by a local drunk hard case. Wasn't a hard case to crack. Got directions to library. Good.
2. Library in operation. Decided to browse. Found a sculpture of a bound and dancing dog and a scroll of Roskoe's consuming glare. Took them both, no one noticed.
3. Left library, didn't burn it down.

# Church of Sisters of the Black Saint
1. Came across a rioting mob outside the church. Sisters were about to execute 2 heretics. Threw tomato. Got dragged out by the sisters, were very confrontational.
   Asked: do you accept the black cloth? Decided to play along. Was taken inside, placed in room with novice. Asks questions. I knock him out with an idol.
2. Found a hole in the wall. Dragged unconcious novice in, I went in to explore between the walls. Came across ritual. Was spotted, decided to crash the party
   by dumping a wall on top of one and killing the high priestess and another. 4th surrendered, got knocked out. Looted a manuscript and a map. Good fight.
