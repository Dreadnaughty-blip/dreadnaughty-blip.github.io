title: Thoughts on Wargames

So I've been thinking on wargames, and how they relate to RPGs and how we play RPGs. 

First off, real wargames suck. They are boring, and involve a whole lot of excel (which we can all agree is the worst
part of any RPG, including D&D). Real wargames are about logistics, about intel, about diplomacy. About knowing when 
to fight, and knowing when n√≥t to. Wait. That sounds a lot like... any RPG.
