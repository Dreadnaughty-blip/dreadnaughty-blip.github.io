### Meet Usk, a fanged deserter with terrible teeth

His first, short foray took him into the 'Torture Tunnels' where he was supposed to find the son of his employer...
only to find a wyvern and a stack of bones left over from all the boys the cult has sacrificed to this monster. 
It was difficult, but he managed to kill the damn thing and find some pretty awesome loot in the tunnels. 

> Now all he needs to do is tell his employer the result. Yeah.
