<h1>Descend into the (2D6) Dungeon</h1>
After finding his way through already a thousand different horrors, Perrywick descended into the dungeon of Damaz in order to deliver the Grimfang of Gromril to the Shrine of Damaz and perform the Vigil of the Bitter Stone. 
Starting off in the first level of the dungeon, he soon found himself discovering a giant network of tunnels descending deeper and deeper in the mountain. To his dismay, the dungeon where the Shrine of Damaz is supposed to be located is 10 levels deep (!!)

Gripping his double bladed and double handed axe, steadying his resolve and blowing out a big old raspberry, he descened into the deep. 

<h1>System</h1>
For this dungeon delve, I've chosen the<a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/455846/2d6-dungeon-a-solo-dungeon-crawler" target="_blank" title="Find 2D6 Dungeon on DriveThruRPG"> 2D6 Dungeon System</a>. It's been a blast even though it has a bit of set-up.

As it stands, Perrywick is in level 4 of the Dungeon. He is well equipped with a double-handed axe, a long leather jacket, a great helm and gauntlets. I guess even Slayers tend to button up when shit is getting hairy. Unlike most dwarfs,
Perrywick relies on postions to survive the hardest challenges, but he's a Halfling, so that's alright :). Adds to the flavor. Perrywick is leaning into the dwarven' favorite pastime of axe throwing and really getting to use it too. After finding
a bunch of throwing axes he's been utilizing a turn 1 throw, sometimes even ending the encounter early. 

The 2D6 system is action packed and moves quickly. Drawing a room, rolling for contents and then dealing with it is fast, and really fun. You don't need that much to get going, but I do find the sheer amount of tables in the codex to be a bit of a pain: 
In printed form you'll need a binder or a book/magazine kind of booklet. I've been trying to use this digitally but the scrolling up and down gets a bit tedious over time. But that's basically the only gripe I have with the system.
