# I attended a local RPG night
And it was pretty spectacular. Going in, I had no idea of the awesome overlap between the LGTBQIA+ scene, the metal scene and RPG-
enthusiasts. I sat in on a table developing an indie RPG, and although it was loud (very loud) in the bar, I didn't know any rules
relating to this RPG and the various characters (both in-game and out-of-game) were both bewildering and dazzling.
