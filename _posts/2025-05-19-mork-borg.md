So I've been running a Mörk Borg campaign and let me tell you... it's good. It's so dark and horrible and 
everything feels like re-arranging the deck chairs or polishing the brass on the Titanic: it's all going
down man! And for some reason... it's enticing. The last few days/months/years before everything is going to 
absolute shit and here I am, fighting doom metal monsters and black rock lava knife-wielding demons and it all
seems balancing on the edge of a cliff. It's awesome. It's concerning. It's Mörk Borg.

### Meet Usk, a fanged deserter with terrible teeth

His first, short foray took him into the 'Torture Tunnels' where he was supposed to find the son of his employer...
only to find a wyvern and a stack of bones left over from all the boys the cult has sacrificed to this monster. 
It was difficult, but he managed to kill the damn thing and find some pretty awesome loot in the tunnels. 

> Now all he needs to do is tell his employer the result. Yeah.
